## About Me

Hi, I am Andreas Ländle 👋. I'm father of two 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦, a passionate software engineer 👨‍💻 and in my spare time ultra-runner 🏃‍♂️.

## About This Blog

This is purely a personal blog for me to take notes, but I hope it is also worthwhile for others. If I can get some feedback from others, it's better.
